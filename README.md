## Motivation

In this personal project I implemented a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the camera. The training data is from the MNIST dataset, hence giving the name Cam + MNIST. The model I built is a fully connected neural net with a single hidden layer of 300 units.

## Dependency

`numpy` `cv2`
